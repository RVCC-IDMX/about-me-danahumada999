          <h2>Image Hover Effects</h2>
          </section>
          <section id="artical">
          <div>

              <p>In today’s world the internet is everything and if your webpage doesn't stand out then it will be left in the dust. Websites need to not only provide valuable content but also engage visitors in a dynamic and visually appealing way. One effective way to achieve this is using image hover effects. This simple feature brings a new layer of design to your website which in return will make people want to stay on the website longer instead of immediately leaving. Image hover effects can be used to enlarge an image, add or fade color, or display text over the image as seen on the bottom of this article. However before adding image hover effects it is best to always make sure that the effect you are going to use will fit the design of your webpage and not feel out of place for example if your webpage is about cancer research you shouldn't be having colorful hover effects you should have something serious like a text pop up hover effect.</p>

              <p>Some advantages of using image hover effects are allowing you to engage with the users of a website by image hover effects a user could be scrolling on the website and come across the image and the image effect will trigger causing them to be more interested in the image. Another advantage could be increased sales if the right hover effects are used. You could see an increase in sales because people tend to buy things if they can get better looks at them using hover effects you make and image 3D and make it spin so the user can really see the product and make more purchases on your webpage. Some different types of image hover effects are opacity change that changes the opacity of an image from translucent to fully opaque when hovered over. This is the code for the opacity change hover effect  .image-container img { opacity: 0.1; transition: opacity 0.3s ease;} .image-container:hover img { opacity: 1;}. Another type of hover effect is a rotate effect this rotates the image to the left or to the right depending on how you code it. The code for this is .rotate-image { transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; } .rotate-image hover { transform: rotate(15deg);}. Finally one last effect is blur image hover effect this blurs the image when it is hovered over. The code for this is .blur img{ transition: 1s ease; } .blur img:hover { -webkit-filter: blur(5px); transition: 1s ease; }.</p>
              
              <p>In conclusion one way to engage with users on your website and keep your website from being bland is by using image hover effects because not only will it give your webpage a breath of fresh air it will also keep eyes on the page and keep it from becoming just another boring page on the internet but it is also good to remember that not all image effects are suitable for all websites and should be picked by checking what looks best for your webpage not just what looks the coolest.</p>
